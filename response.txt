You're having trouble understanding how flexbox works in CSS.

Flexbox is indeed discussed later on in the course, starting from video number 14. 

In video 13, it's actually about other HTML topics such as Flexbox Grid etc., but that's not where you'll learn about flexbox specifically.

If you want to understand more about how flexbox works, I recommend watching video 18 of our course, which is the 3rd part of the CSS Box Model lessons. 

Specifically, you can find an explanation of how flexbox works at timestamp 412 seconds into that video, and also around 708 seconds in.

If you have any more questions about flexbox or anything else related to this topic, feel free to ask!
